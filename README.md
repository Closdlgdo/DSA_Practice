# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms practice problems. I'm using this space to hone my problem-solving skills and improve my understanding of algorithms.

## About

I'm a lead installer at Arizona Furnishings with a background in Computer Science. I graduated with my Bachelors degree from Bellevue University in Nebraska. Currently, I'm relearning JavaScript and have experience with Java, Python, C++, and PHP. I'm also proficient in HTML and CSS. In addition to programming, I enjoy playing chess and watching football (soccer).

/problem2
solution.py

etc...

## How to Use

Each problem directory contains a solution file. I'll be providing explanations within the code using comments to help you understand the thought process behind each solution. You can explore the solutions and the accompanying code comments to gain insights into the problem-solving approach.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! If you'd like to add your own solutions or suggest improvements, please see the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
