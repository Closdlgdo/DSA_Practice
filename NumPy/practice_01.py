# What is NumPy? NumPy is like a special tool for people who work with numbers a lot, especially in programming.
# It makes it much easier to do math and work with big sets of numbers. Imagine if you had to do a lot of calculations
# with a bunch of numbers, like adding, subtracting, or even more complicated stuff. NumPy helps you do all of that
# faster and more efficiently. It's like having a powerful calculator that understands how to handle lots of numbers all
# at once. This can be really handy for tasks like data analysis, scientific computations, and more!
